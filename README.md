ðŸŽ® Excited to share my first completed game â€“ Cube Runner 3D! ðŸš€



In this Unity-based game, you:

ðŸ‘‰ Tap to start

ðŸ‘‰ Collect cubes of the same color as the player

ðŸ‘‰ Avoid obstacles and cubes of other colors â€“ one wrong move ends the game!



This project helped me learn:

âœ” Collision detection

âœ” Rigidbody physics

âœ” Basic game mechanics & UI

If you have any feedback or learning resources, Iâ€™d love to hear from you. ðŸ˜Š
